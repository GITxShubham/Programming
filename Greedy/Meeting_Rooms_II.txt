Given two arrays start[] and end[] such that start[i] is the starting time of ith meeting and end[i] is the ending time of ith meeting. Return the minimum number of rooms required to attend all meetings.

Note: A person can also attend a meeting if it's starting time is same as the previous meeting's ending time.

Examples:

Input: start[] = [1, 10, 7], end[] = [4, 15, 10]
Output: 1
Explanation: Since all the meetings are held at different times, it is possible to attend all the meetings in a single room.
Input: start[] = [2, 9, 6], end[] = [4, 12, 10]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1st and 2nd meetings at one room but for 3rd meeting one another room required.


CODE : 

class Solution {
  public:
    int minMeetingRooms(vector<int> &start, vector<int> &ending) {
        // code here
        sort(start.begin() , start.end());
        sort(ending.begin() , ending.end());
        int ans = 0 , rooms = 0 , i = 0 , j = 0;
        while(i < start.size() and j < ending.size()){
            if(start[i] < ending[j]){
                // Meeting has started
                rooms++;
                ans = max(rooms ,ans);
                i++;
            }
            else if(start[i] > ending[j]){
                // Meeting has ended
                rooms--;
                j++;
            }
            else{
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
