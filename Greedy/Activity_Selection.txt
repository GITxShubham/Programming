Description:
You are given a set of activities, each with a start time and a finish time, represented by the arrays start[] and finish[], respectively. A single person can perform only one activity at a time, meaning no two activities can overlap. Your task is to determine the maximum number of activities that a person can complete in a day.

Examples:

Input: start[] = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5], finish[] = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
Output: 4
Explanation: A person can perform at most four activities. The maximum set of activities that can be executed is {0, 1, 3, 4}
Input: start[] = [10, 12, 20], finish[] = [20, 25, 30]
Output: 1
Explanation: A person can perform at most one activity.
Input: start[] = [1, 3, 2, 5], finish[] = [2, 4, 3, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: A person can perform activities 0, 1 and 3.
Constraints:
1 ≤ start.size() = finish.size() ≤ 2*105
0 ≤ start[i] ≤ finish[i] ≤ 109




CODE : 


bool cmp(vector<int>& a , vector<int>&b){
    return a[1] < b[1];
}
class Solution {
  public:
    int activitySelection(vector<int> &start, vector<int> &finish) {
        // code here
        vector<vector<int>> intervals(start.size());
        for(int i = 0 ; i < start.size() ; i++) intervals[i] = {start[i] , finish[i]};
        sort(intervals.begin() , intervals.end() , cmp);
        int count = 0;
        int Lastendtime = intervals[0][1];
        for(int i = 1 ; i < intervals.size() ; i++){
            if(intervals[i][0] <= Lastendtime) count++;
            else Lastendtime = intervals[i][1];
        }
        return intervals.size() - count;
    }
};
