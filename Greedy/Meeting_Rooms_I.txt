Description : 
Given a 2D array arr[][], where arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.

Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's ending time.

Examples:

Input: arr[][] = [[1, 4], [10, 15], [7, 10]]
Output: true
Explanation: Since all the meetings are held at different times, it is possible to attend all the meetings.
Input: arr[][] = [[2, 4], [9, 12], [6, 10]]
Output: false
Explanation: Since the second and third meeting overlap, a person cannot attend all the meetings.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 2*106



CODE : 

class Solution {
  public:
    bool canAttend(vector<vector<int>> &arr) {
        // Code Here
        if(arr.size() == 0) return true;
        vector<int> start , ending;
        for(auto x : arr){
            start.push_back(x[0]);
            ending.push_back(x[1]);
        }
        sort(start.begin() , start.end());
        sort(ending.begin() , ending.end());
        int ans = 0 , rooms = 0 , i = 0 , j = 0;
        while(i < start.size() and j < ending.size()){
            if(start[i] < ending[j]){
                // Meeting has started
                rooms++;
                ans = max(rooms ,ans);
                i++;
            }
            else if(start[i] > ending[j]){
                // Meeting has ended
                rooms--;
                j++;
            }
            else{
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }
        return ans == 1;
    }
